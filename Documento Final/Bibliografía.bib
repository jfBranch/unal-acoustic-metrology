abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

An otpimal threshold is selected by the discriminant criterion, namely, so as the maximize the separability of the resultant classes in gray levels.

@article{Lowe2004,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The precision and accuracy of acoustic instrument calibrations is fundamental in ensuring the validity and defensibility of acoustic measurements. The measurement error is additive to the overall uncertainty or error associated with acoustic calculations and modelling techniques, where these rely on measurement data as a source of acoustic data. Therefore, the tolerance of the calibration is a fundamental component in determining the accuracy of all applications that rely on acoustic measurement data. National and International metrology standards define the methodologies adopted in acoustic calibration. Currently the IEC 61672 standard is adopted for the periodic testing of field instruments. This paper provides an overviewof the changes in calibration requirements of the IEC 61672 standard relative to the earlier versions of IEC 61672 and the IEC 652 standard. The paper then explores in more detail from an end user perspective the implications of calibration methodologies and the overall accuracy of acoustic data.},

Then a novel automatic calibration system based on image recognition technology for frequency weighting functions of SLM is presented. Firstly, the system can realise automatic calibration of sound fields which produce expected standard sound pressure both in anechoic chamber and active coupler. Through the image recognition technology, it can obtain the measured value of SLM automatically. This unique feature solves the problem that many automatic calibration systems can't deal with SLMs which don't have electrical output interface so that it enlarges the application scope of our system. In addition, the system can generate final reports automatically according to the calibration results. The experiment results show that our system has the features of high-efficiency, easy-operation, and good-universality and it is well competent for routine calibration work for SLM. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},
